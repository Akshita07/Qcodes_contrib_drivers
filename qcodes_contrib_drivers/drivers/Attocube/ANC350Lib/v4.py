#
#  ANC350lib is a Python implementation of the C++ header provided
#     with the attocube ANC350 closed-loop positioner system.
#
#  It depends on anc350v4.dll and libusb0.dll, which are provided by attocube in the
#     ANC350_Library folder on the driver disc. Place all
#     of these in the same folder as this module (and that of ANC350lib).
#     This should also work with anc350v3.dll, although this has not been thoroughly checked.
